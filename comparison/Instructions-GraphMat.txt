Our evalation uses a modified version of GraphMat to correct the following issues:
    - PageRank: allow number of iterations to be specified
    - BFS: eliminate the 255-iteration cap (this artificially terminates the algorithm early)
    - CC: add an implementation of this application (it is not supplied in the distribution)
    - Misc: enable compilation using a GNU-based toolchain

To obtain this modified version, apply the supplied patch to the original source code:
    1. wget https://github.com/narayanan2004/GraphMat/archive/v1.0-single-node.tar.gz
    2. tar -xzvf v1.0-single-node.tar.gz
    3. cd GraphMat-1.0-single-node
    4. patch -p1 < [path-to-graphmat-patch]

To build GraphMat after producing the modified version:
    1. cd GraphMat-1.0-single-node
    2. make -j [num-jobs]

Do not attempt to run GraphMat with uk-2007, otherwise it will crash.
This is due to a GraphMat implementation issue, as described in the paper.

GraphMat outputs application running time in milliseconds to the console.

To run PageRank (Figure 11):
    numactl -N [numa-nodes] -i [numa-nodes] bin/PageRank [graph-path] [num-iters]

To run CC (Figure 12):
    numactl -N [numa-nodes] -i [numa-nodes] bin/CC [graph-path]

To run BFS (Figure 13):
    numactl -N [numa-nodes] -i [numa-nodes] bin/BFS [graph-path] 1
